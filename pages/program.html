                    <span class="session-tooltip">
                        Deep supervised learning is the go-to technique for most state-of-the-art results in tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. However, these are heavily dependent on the availability of large and well-representative, expensive datasets. Here, we will focus on graph learning with minimal supervision. We will start by motivating graphs as a natural generalisation for medical data, along with the power of unlabelled data for designing robust and efficient algorithmic techniques. We will cover fundamental aspects such as graph neural networks, building graphs from minimal supervision, and learning graph representations. Finally, we will delve into these aspects using graph functionals. This hybrid approaches to intertwine classic and deep learning algorithms for medical robust solutions. Theory will be accompanied by real-world examples This lecture is a short version of our yearly MICCAI tutorial on Graph and Hypergraph Learning.
