I am an Associate Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. My laboratory, the Computational Imaging of Brain Organization Research Group (CIBORG), specializes in advanced computational methods to study brain anatomy and function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our work aims to improve our understanding of neurological disorders, as well as normal and abnormal brain development, in both high- and low-resource settings.
CIBORG’s research places a strong emphasis on designing computational imaging tools that address global health challenges and promote a future where medical innovation is more equitable and accessible worldwide. While our primary focus is on early childhood, our research spans the entire lifespan—from the fetal stage through old age. In addition to our academic work, both through CIBORG and the startup I co-founded, Voxel Healthcare, we are developing software to provide quantitative assessments of medical images to support clinicians in their daily practice.
I hold a BSc in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Montreal and a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Cambridge, where I studied general relativity. I earned a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Harvard University, focusing on quantum chaos in quantum billiards on flat surfaces and the pseudosphere. I transitioned to neuroimaging during my postdoctoral fellowship at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging at UCLA.
