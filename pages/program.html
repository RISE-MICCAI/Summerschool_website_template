                    <span class="session-tooltip">
                        Deep supervised learning is the go-to technique for most state-of-the-art results in tasks such as classification, segmentation, and detection. However, these are heavily dependent on the availability of large and well-representative, expensive datasets. Here, we will focus on graph learning with minimal supervision. We will start by motivating graphs as a natural generalisation for medical data, along with the power of unlabelled data for designing robust and efficient algorithmic techniques. We will cover fundamental aspects such as graph neural networks, building graphs from minimal supervision, and learning graph representations. Finally, we will delve into these aspects using graph functionals. This hybrid approaches to intertwine classic and deep learning algorithms for medical robust solutions. Theory will be accompanied by real-world examples This lecture is a short version of our yearly MICCAI tutorial on Graph and Hypergraph Learning.

                        This lecture will cover the basics of using git to put a repository together and manage change using its software versioning system. This will cover the basic commands and concepts which you will use to put your own repository together for the day's events. The second part of the lecture will cover the use of the Docker container platform, specifically covering how to create an image for your code and run the container made from it to deploy your work. This will also cover the basic level of Docker but will include additional resources and exercises to help you going forward.
