Udunna Anazodo, PhD, Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, is also a member of the Neuroimaging and Neuroinformatics research group at The Neuro. She joined The Neuro from the Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ontario where she was Assistant Professor of Medical Biophysics.

Udunnaâ€™s research at The Neuro focuses on intelligent PET imaging for mapping brain health: from molecules to mind.  Her lab combines positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to provide a multimodal imaging approach for detecting subtle and early changes in brain function, physiology and neurochemistry. Her current focus is on the optimization of next-generation ultra-high-resolution PET imaging systems to permit molecular brain imaging with unprecedented spatial precision and sensitivity. Over the next five years, they will develop leading-edge intelligent PET image reconstruction and image analysis tools that leverage advances in machine learning to enable brain imaging in clinical populations at ultra-high spatial resolution and unmatched sensitivity.
